>Program Description
The program creates a server using socket programming in python to which any client can connect using netcat.
Multiple clients can connect to the server and send messages to it which the server sends to all other clients
Hence, it can be used a message broadcasting chat room. 
This program uses socke programming module "socket" for hosting and managing server and client sockets, threading module "threading" for maintaining different concurrent client sockets, and system module "sys" to take command line arguments

>Challenges faced and how they were addressed
	>finding which ip address and port
		solution: reading and getting to know more about the different IPs and available ports a system maintains 
	>maintaining multiple concurrent clients, sending message from one
		solution: using threading we can manage multiple client sockets as different threads
